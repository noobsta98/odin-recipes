The Project is about building a site that redirects the user to recipes for 
different dishes.

The skills needed to see this project through is a basic understanding of the 
html elements. A good understanding of <a> anchor tags that redirect the 
user to a recipe site is required. The project also makes use of image,
orderer list and unordered list tags to build the barebones of the website.
